# dspesquisa

This is an application called DsPesquisa (Big Game Survey).

Basically the responses of gamers are collected through a mobile application about which games are preferred by gamers, requesting information such as name, age, platform and genre of the game. Thus, the web application displays the list of all captured records and the graphs of the responses.

The following technologies were used: Java with Spring boot on the back end, JavaScript / TypeScript on the front end - ReactJS for web and React Native for mobile.
PostgreSQL was the database used.
